                        <p>I am proud to announce Charm - my first solo project! This game is created out of reminiscence for my first game Incantus Sorcerers, it will be the foundation of our community and a statement of what i am capable of doing alone.</p>
                        <p>Development will be rapid as solo developing can be very efficient, espescially for games like these which will hold a lot of mechanics that need to be understood. I am very excited for this experience and cant wait releasing it to the public!</p>
